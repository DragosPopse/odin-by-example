# Odin by Example

This repository aims to be a quick start for complete beginners, be it Odin or programming in general.

## Release schedule

I'm writing this examples on my own free time. Expect at least 1 example every day.

## Building the examples

All examples can be built using `odin <build/run> <folder name>`. All examples assume the working directory is the root of this repository. This is important for examples that work with the file system.

## Contributing

If you want to see an example, please submit an issue. If you want to write an example yourself, feel free to submit a PR and I will merge it quickly.
